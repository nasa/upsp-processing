# Run the uPSP project build system and unit tests.
# Artifacts are installed into the runner's system Python 3 environment.
#
# Notes:
#
# - Initially considered installing all dependencies via system
#   package manager, but encountered some GH-specific "pain points"
#   (e.g., HDF5 v1.12 is not supported out-of-box by ubuntu-latest).
#   Simpler and more robust to manage with third-party C/C++ package
#   manager like vcpkg.
#
# - Some system dependencies may not be needed... accidentally tried
#   vcpkg install without explicitly disabling default opencv4 features
#   which include a LOT of extras with frontend library deps like x11.
#   TODO consider pruning at a later date.
#
# - Making use of third-party actions for improved caching + invocation
#   of CMake and vcpkg. Ref: https://github.com/marketplace/actions/run-vcpkg
#   Recommendations from author highlight using vcpkg as a Git submodule...
#   this is NOT desirable in our case because for native deployment to
#   HPC clusters, oftentimes the user-supplied /home folder has quite limited
#   storage and is not appropriate for caching lots of external submodules.
#   Instead, we pin the vcpkg release here (vcpkgGitCommitId) and maintain
#   consistency manually.
#
# - On NAS HECC systems, we build the C/C++ code with dynamic linkage due
#   to the available system dependencies. This is *not* a default
#   target supported by vcpkg, but it has a lot of community interest and
#   "unofficial" testing support. Ref: https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/15006
#   We patch up some of the RPATH quirks using 'patchelf'.
